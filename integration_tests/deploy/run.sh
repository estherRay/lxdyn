# Deployment smoke test — the coverage A4b owes back.
#
# Deleting docker-compose removed the only test in the repo that crossed a real network
# boundary, and every compose file carried `no_proxy` — scar tissue from a proxy that once
# broke this. The 9 native gRPC scenarios replaced it with loopback in one process tree,
# which is faster and reproducible but proves nothing about *packaging*.
#
# So this proves exactly three things, and deliberately no more:
#   1. the deploy image starts
#   2. it runs a real simulation on a bind-mounted workdir, and the output is readable by the
#      invoking user -- that second half is the uid-mapping assertion, see USERNS below
#   3. a containerised gRPC server with a published port is reachable from outside it, with
#      the server's own logs used to confirm the traffic rather than trusting the client
#
# It is NOT a protocol test — integration_tests/grpc_tests covers the protocol, natively, in
# 25 s with no daemon. Do not grow this file into a second copy of that suite; the whole
# point of A4b was that a test needing a container daemon is a test nobody runs.

# integrates, so it is finite and deterministic, while still making xdyn's C++ gRPC client
# call out to the containerised wave server. That call is the only thing this step asserts.
