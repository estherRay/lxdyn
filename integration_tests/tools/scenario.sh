# Shared harness for the native gRPC & JSON integration scenarios.
#
# These used to be docker-compose stacks: one container per process. Compose supplied
# exactly four things -- hostname discovery, volume mounts, uid mapping, and startup
# ordering. With static binaries and an importable xdyngrpc, only the last one still
# matters, and that is a port poll, not an orchestrator. So each scenario is now a shell
# script that starts the same processes on localhost.
#
# Usage, from <scenario>/run.sh:
#
#     #!/bin/sh
#     set -eu
#     . "$(dirname "$0")/../../tools/scenario.sh"
#     scenario waves               # sets $WORK, cds into it, arms the cleanup trap
#     demos                        # generate the tutorial inputs into $WORK
#     serve waves-server "$PYTHON" -m xdyngrpc.waves.server.airy
#     wait_port 50051
#     serve xdyn "$BIN/xdyn-for-cs" tutorial_09_gRPC_wave_model.yml -g --dt 1 -p 9002
#     wait_port 9002
#     pytest tests.py
#
# Every background process is logged to $WORK/<label>.log and killed on exit. If the
# scenario fails, those logs are dumped -- that is the one thing `docker-compose up`
# gave for free that a bare `&` does not.
