/*
 * demo_scripts.cpp
 *
 * The post-processing scripts, embedded as data.
 *
 * This file replaces tools/embed_demo.py (and, before it, build.zig's
 * DemoGenStep). That generator wrote 55 lines of
 * Python to emit one `<<"line"<<std::endl` per source line; everything the
 * emitted code actually did — the two substitutions and the H5 write — happened
 * at *runtime*, so none of it needed generating. `#embed` puts the bytes in
 * directly and the generator ceases to exist, which is also what removes the
 * build's last bare `python3`.
 *
 * `#embed` is C23; clang accepts it in C++ as an extension (zig 0.16 ships
 * clang 21), hence -Wno-c23-extensions on this one file in build.zig. The
 * embedded files are recorded in clang's depfile, so editing a script rebuilds
 * this TU — which the `has_side_effects`
 * shell step it replaced could not do.
