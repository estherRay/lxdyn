# Every flavor names an explicit target, including the native one. That is what makes the build
# hermetic: with no -target, zig treats the compile as native and honours CPATH, which inside
# `nix develop` means glibc 2.42 plus every libstdc++ C++ library in the flake's buildInputs.
# An explicit target switches zig to its own bundled headers and nothing else.
#
# glibc 2.28 is the floor because it is the oldest still in service — Debian 10, RHEL 8,
# Ubuntu 18.04. It also fixes what a published closure can link against: build against a newer
# glibc and its headers redirect to symbols (__isoc23_strtol and friends) that older systems
# do not have, so the final link fails on the user's machine rather than here.
# A flavor IS its target triple. Two-thirds of one does not identify a closure: x86_64-linux-gnu
# and x86_64-linux-musl differ only in the libc, which is exactly what a closure carries. The
# directory, the release asset, the mise task and build.zig's default all use this name.
