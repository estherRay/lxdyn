# b2 is bootstrapped here rather than in build-boost.sh: the source tree is shared, so
# bootstrapping per flavor would have the flavors race. b2 is a host tool -- it reads Jamfiles
# and spawns compilers, and nothing it links ever reaches the closure.
#
# Built by zig, and deliberately NOT through bootstrap.sh: that script clears CXX before
# probing the host for a compiler and passes nothing through, so no variable can steer it.
# The engine's own build.sh takes --cxx. Without this the closure build silently needs a host
# C++ compiler nobody declared -- the devShell has had none since C23, so b2 was being built
# by whatever /usr/bin happened to offer, and the build simply failed on a machine with none.
#
# musl, so b2 comes out statically linked and runs on any Linux of this architecture. It
# outlives the shell that made it: $SRC is shared across flavors and can be shared between
# clones, so a b2 tied to one machine's glibc would be a trap (see Hazard T).
